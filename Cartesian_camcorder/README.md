# Cartesian Camcorder Model

A C++ implementation of the Cartesian Camcorder model of consciousness, which proposes that consciousness is a physical, mechanical process of smart recording and playback of selected mental events.

## Overview

The Cartesian Camcorder model addresses the problem of infinite regress in consciousness by proposing that:

1. **Consciousness is mechanical**: It emerges from the physical process of recording and playing back mental events
2. **Smart recordings**: Unlike literal recordings, the system creates high-level, abstracted representations of cognitive events
3. **Recursive awareness**: The same mechanical system can observe its own observations, creating consciousness of consciousness
4. **Single observer**: One physical system handles all levels of awareness, avoiding the need for infinite separate observers

## Key Components

### Core Data Structures

- **`CognitiveEvent`**: Represents fundamental mental occurrences (perceptions, thoughts, emotions) that are initially unconscious
- **`SmartRecording`**: High-level, processed representations of cognitive events that constitute consciousness
- **`CartesianCamcorder`**: The central system responsible for recording and playback operations
- **`PlanningApparatus`**: The cognitive system that uses smart recordings for planning and voluntary actions

### How It Works

1. **Recording**: The camcorder records salient cognitive events, transforming them into smart recordings
2. **Playback**: Playing back a recording creates awareness of that event
3. **Recursive Recording**: The awareness event can itself be recorded, creating consciousness of consciousness
4. **Infinite Regress Solution**: The same physical system handles all levels, creating a "parade of self versions"

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or MSVC 2017+)
- Make (for building)

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Build the project
make

# Run the demonstration
make run

# Build with debug symbols
make debug

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Manual Compilation

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o cartesian_camcorder \
    main.cpp cognitive_event.cpp smart_recording.cpp \
    planning_apparatus.cpp cartesian_camcorder.cpp
```

## Example Output

The demonstration shows:

1. Creation of perception events (e.g., seeing a red flower)
2. Recording these events (bestowing consciousness)
3. Playing back recordings (creating awareness)
4. Recording awareness (recursive consciousness)
5. Higher-level consciousness through repeated playback/recording cycles

```
=== Cartesian Camcorder Model Demonstration ===
Step 1: Creating initial perception events...
Created: <perception at 1: red flower>
Created: <perception at 1.1: tall tree>

Step 2: Recording events (bestowing consciousness)...
Recorded: <SmartRecording of perception: red flower>
Recorded: <SmartRecording of perception: tall tree>

Step 3: Playing back recordings (creating awareness)...
Planning Apparatus notes: 'I am now conscious of red flower'
Created awareness event: <awareness_of_playback at 1.01: [complex content]>

...
```

## Key Features

- **Modern C++**: Uses C++17 features including `std::any`, smart pointers, and structured bindings
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with proper encapsulation
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new event types and processing logic
- **Educational**: Clear demonstration of the consciousness model

## Theoretical Background

This implementation demonstrates how the Cartesian Camcorder model solves the infinite regress problem in consciousness studies by:

1. **Unified System**: One mechanical process handles all levels of awareness
2. **Physical Implementation**: No need for non-physical observers or homunculi
3. **Recursive Capability**: The same system can observe its own observations
4. **Finite Resources**: Works within the constraints of a finite brain
